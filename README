Phitherek_' s SLM - Simple Login Method
A login system in PHP - for now only in Polish version.

TODO:
- include file with functions for managing custom variables in user files (unfortunately my method for this doesn' t work. I leave it in TODO. If you have an idea how to do it, please fork this repo and write it.).
- CSS classes in wiki.
- examples for the first point of TODO (if you will write it).

All right, so now the main SLM is done and ready to use. Enjoy!

example: Branch created to show examples of using includes and functions of SLM. Contains additional scripts which create fully functional login system.
