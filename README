Phitherek_' s SLM - Simple Login Method
A login system in PHP - for now only in Polish version.

TODO:
- include file with functions for managing custom variables in user files.
- describe all the include files and functions in Wiki.
- in slm_admin.php - warning (as in master' s README).
- examples for the first point of TODO.

All right, so now the main SLM is done and ready to use. Enjoy!

example: Branch created to show examples of using includes and functions of SLM. Contains additional scripts which are fully functional login system.
